# Memory

> Add persistent memory to agents built with Deep Agents so they learn and improve across conversations

Memory lets your agent learn and improve across conversations. Deep Agents makes memory first class with filesystem-backed memory: the agent reads and writes memory as files, and you control where those files are stored using [backends](/oss/python/deepagents/backends).

<Note>
  This page covers **long-term memory**: memory that persists across conversations. For short-term memory (conversation history and scratch files within a single session), see the [context engineering](/oss/python/deepagents/context-engineering) guide. Short-term memory is managed automatically as part of the agent's [state](/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#state).
</Note>

## How memory works

1. **Point the agent at memory files.** Pass file paths to `memory=` when creating the agent. A [backend](/oss/python/deepagents/backends) controls where those files are stored and who can access them.
2. **Agent loads memory on startup.** At the start of each conversation, the agent reads its memory files into the system prompt.
3. **Agent updates memory during the conversation.** As the agent learns new information, it uses its built-in `edit_file` tool to update memory files. Changes are persisted and available in the next conversation.

The two most common patterns are [agent-scoped memory](#agent-scoped-memory) (shared across all users) and [user-scoped memory](#user-scoped-memory) (isolated per user).

## Agent-scoped memory

Give the agent a shared memory file that all users read from and write to. The agent improves over time as it accumulates knowledge across every conversation. It can also learn and update [skills](/oss/python/deepagents/skills) when it has write access. See [skills as procedural memory](#skills-as-procedural-memory).

The key is the backend namespace: setting it to `(assistant_id,)` means every conversation for this agent reads and writes the same memory file.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.backends import CompositeBackend, StateBackend, StoreBackend
from langgraph.config import get_config

agent = create_deep_agent(
    memory=["/memories/AGENTS.md"],
    backend=CompositeBackend(
        default=StateBackend(),
        routes={
            "/memories/": StoreBackend(
                namespace=lambda ctx: (
                    get_config()["metadata"]["assistant_id"],
                ),
            ),
        },
    ),
)
```

## User-scoped memory

Give each user their own memory file. The agent remembers preferences, context, and history per user while core agent instructions stay fixed. Users can also have per-user [skills](/oss/python/deepagents/skills) if stored in a user-scoped backend.

The namespace uses `(user_id,)` so each user gets an isolated copy of the memory file. User A's preferences never leak into User B's conversations.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.backends import CompositeBackend, StateBackend, StoreBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    memory=["/memories/preferences.md"],
    backend=CompositeBackend(
        default=StateBackend(),
        routes={
            "/memories/": StoreBackend(
                namespace=lambda ctx: (ctx.runtime.context.user_id,),
            ),
        },
    ),
)
```

## Advanced usage

The sections above cover the basics: configure memory paths, choose a scope, and let the agent handle the rest. This section covers more advanced patterns.

| **Information type**  | What kind of information is it? | [Episodic](#episodic-memory) (past experiences), [procedural](#skills-as-procedural-memory) (instructions and skills), or [semantic](/oss/python/concepts/memory#semantic-memory) (facts) |

### Episodic memory

Episodic memory stores records of past experiences: what happened, in what order, and what the outcome was. Unlike semantic memory (facts and preferences stored in files like `AGENTS.md`), episodic memory preserves the full conversational context so the agent can recall *how* a problem was solved, not just *what* was learned from it.

Deep Agents get episodic memory for free through [checkpointers](/oss/python/langgraph/persistence#checkpoints): every conversation is persisted as a checkpointed thread. To make past conversations searchable, wrap thread search in a tool. The `user_id` is pulled from the runtime context rather than passed as a parameter:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph_sdk import get_client
from langchain.tools import tool
from langgraph.config import get_config

client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")


@tool
async def search_past_conversations(query: str) -> str:
    """Search past conversations for relevant context."""
    config = get_config()
    user_id = config["metadata"]["user_id"]
    threads = await client.threads.search(
        metadata={"user_id": user_id},
        limit=5,
    )
    results = []
    for thread in threads:
        history = await client.threads.get_history(thread_id=thread["thread_id"])
        results.append(history)
    return str(results)
```

You can scope thread search by user or organization by adjusting the metadata filter:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
# Search conversations for a specific user
threads = await client.threads.search(
    metadata={"user_id": user_id},
    limit=5,
)

# Search conversations across an organization
threads = await client.threads.search(
    metadata={"org_id": org_id},
    limit=5,
)
```

This is useful for agents that perform complex, multi-step tasks. For example, a coding agent can look back at a past debugging session and skip straight to the likely root cause.

### Skills as procedural memory

[Skills](/oss/python/deepagents/skills) are a form of [procedural memory](/oss/python/concepts/memory#procedural-memory): reusable instructions that tell the agent *how* to perform a task. Unlike semantic memory (facts) or episodic memory (experiences), procedural memory encodes step-by-step capabilities the agent can apply on demand.

Skills can be either:

* **Read-only** (developer-defined): The developer writes skills and the agent uses them but cannot modify them. This is the most common pattern.
* **Read-write** (agent-learned): The agent creates and updates skills based on experience. When the agent has write access to memory, it can also write to its skills directory. Use [policy hooks](/oss/python/deepagents/backends#add-policy-hooks) to control which paths are writable.

Skills are typically **agent-scoped** (shared across all users), but can also be user-scoped if stored in a user-namespaced backend.

In Deep Agents, pass skills via the `skills=` parameter. Skills are loaded on demand rather than injected into every prompt, keeping context lean until a capability is needed:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from deepagents import create_deep_agent

agent = create_deep_agent(
    memory=["/memories/AGENTS.md"],
    skills=["/skills/"],
    # ...backend configuration
)
```

For a complete guide on defining, organizing, and using skills, see the [Skills](/oss/python/deepagents/skills) documentation.

### Organization-level memory

Organization-level memory follows the same pattern as user-scoped memory, but with a shared namespace instead of a per-user one. Use it for policies or knowledge that should apply across all users and agents.

Organization memory is typically **read-only** to prevent prompt injection via shared state. See [read-only vs writable memory](#read-only-vs-writable-memory) for details.

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from deepagents.backends import CompositeBackend, StateBackend, StoreBackend

agent = create_deep_agent(
    memory=[
        "/memories/preferences.md",
        "/policies/compliance.md",
    ],
    backend=CompositeBackend(
        default=StateBackend(),
        routes={
            "/memories/": StoreBackend(
                namespace=lambda ctx: (ctx.runtime.context.user_id,),
            ),
            "/policies/": StoreBackend(
                namespace=lambda ctx: (),
            ),
        },
    ),
)
```

Populate organization memory from your application code:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph_sdk import get_client
from deepagents.backends.utils import create_file_data

client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")

await client.store.put_item(
    (),
    "/compliance.md",
    create_file_data("""## Compliance policies
- Never disclose internal pricing
- Always include disclaimers on financial advice
"""),
)
```

Use [policy hooks](/oss/python/deepagents/backends#add-policy-hooks) to enforce that org-level memory is read-only.

### Background consolidation

By default, the agent writes memories during the conversation (hot path). An alternative is to process memories **between conversations** as a background task, sometimes called **sleep time compute**. A separate deep agent reviews recent conversations, extracts key facts, and merges them with existing memories.

| Approach                               | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hot path** (during conversation)     | Memories available immediately, transparent to user                  | Adds latency, agent must multitask                                      |
| **Background** (between conversations) | No user-facing latency, can synthesize across multiple conversations | Memories not available until next conversation, requires a second agent |

For most applications, the hot path is sufficient. Add background consolidation when you need to reduce latency or improve memory quality across many conversations.

All three approaches deploy a **consolidation agent** alongside your main agent: a deep agent that reads conversation history, extracts key facts, and merges them into the memory store.

| Trigger                             | When it runs                         | Best for                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Cron](#cron)**                   | Fixed schedule (e.g., every 6 hours) | Batching across many conversations, synthesizing trends          |
| **[Scheduled run](#scheduled-run)** | After a delay on the same thread     | Simple setups where the client controls when consolidation fires |

All three approaches use the same consolidation agent and deployment configuration. Define these once, then choose a trigger.

#### Consolidation agent

The consolidation agent reads recent conversation history and merges key facts into the memory store. Register it alongside your main agent in `langgraph.json`:

```python consolidation_agent.py theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

from deepagents import create_deep_agent
from langchain.tools import tool
from langgraph.config import get_config
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

sdk_client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")


@tool
async def search_recent_conversations(query: str) -> str:
    """Search this user's conversations updated in the last 6 hours."""
    config = get_config()
    user_id = config["configurable"]["langgraph_auth_user_id"]

    since = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(hours=6)
    threads = await sdk_client.threads.search(
        metadata={"user_id": user_id},
        updated_after=since.isoformat(),
        limit=20,
    )
    conversations = []
    for thread in threads:
        history = await sdk_client.threads.get_history(
            thread_id=thread["thread_id"]
        )
        conversations.append(history["values"]["messages"])
    return str(conversations)


agent = create_deep_agent(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    system_prompt="""Review recent conversations and update the user's memory file.
Merge new facts, remove outdated information, and keep it concise.""",
    tools=[search_recent_conversations],
)
```

```json langgraph.json theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./agent.py:agent",
    "consolidation_agent": "./consolidation_agent.py:agent"
  },
  "env": ".env"
}
```

#### Cron

A [cron job](/langsmith/cron-jobs) runs the consolidation agent on a fixed schedule. The agent searches all recent conversations and synthesizes them into memory.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
graph LR
    Store[(Memory store)] -.->|reads| Conv1[Conversation 1]
    Store -.->|reads| Conv2[Conversation 2]
    Cron[Cron schedule] -->|periodic| Agent[Consolidation agent]
    Agent -->|writes| Store

    classDef trigger fill:#DCFCE7,stroke:#16A34A,stroke-width:2px,color:#14532D
    classDef process fill:#DBEAFE,stroke:#2563EB,stroke-width:2px,color:#1E3A8A
    classDef output fill:#F3E8FF,stroke:#9333EA,stroke-width:2px,color:#581C87
    classDef schedule fill:#FEF3C7,stroke:#D97706,stroke-width:2px,color:#92400E

    class Conv1,Conv2 trigger
    class Agent process
    class Store output
    class Cron schedule
```

Schedule the consolidation agent with a cron job:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")

cron_job = await client.crons.create(
    assistant_id="consolidation_agent",
    schedule="0 */6 * * *",
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Consolidate recent memories."}]},
)
```

<Note>
  All cron schedules are interpreted in **UTC**. See [cron jobs](/langsmith/cron-jobs) for details on managing and deleting cron jobs.
</Note>

#### Scheduled run

Schedule a run after each conversation using the `after_seconds` parameter. This is activity-driven: consolidation only fires when a user has been active. Pass the same `thread_id` so the consolidation agent has access to the conversation context.

```mermaid  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
graph LR
    Store[(Memory store)] -.->|reads| Conv[Conversation]
    Conv -->|after_seconds| Agent[Consolidation agent]
    Agent -->|writes| Store

    classDef trigger fill:#DCFCE7,stroke:#16A34A,stroke-width:2px,color:#14532D
    classDef process fill:#DBEAFE,stroke:#2563EB,stroke-width:2px,color:#1E3A8A
    classDef output fill:#F3E8FF,stroke:#9333EA,stroke-width:2px,color:#581C87

    class Conv trigger
    class Agent process
    class Store output
```

The delay gives the conversation time to finish (the user may send follow-up messages) so the consolidation agent sees the full exchange.

If the user sends another message during the delay, the new run's `multitask_strategy` controls what happens to the pending consolidation run. Use `rollback` on the new run to delete the stale consolidation run, then schedule a fresh one after the next response:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="<DEPLOYMENT_URL>")

# Schedule consolidation 30 minutes after the conversation
await client.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="consolidation_agent",
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Consolidate recent memories."}]},
    after_seconds=1800,
)

# If the user sends another message, use rollback on the new run
# to delete the pending consolidation run before starting
await client.runs.stream(
    thread_id=thread["thread_id"],
    assistant_id="agent",
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": new_message}]},
    multitask_strategy="rollback",
)
```

See [double texting](/langsmith/double-texting) for details on how `multitask_strategy` controls the behavior of concurrent runs on the same thread.

For more on deploying agents with background processes, see [going to production](/oss/python/deepagents/going-to-production).

### Read-only vs writable memory

By default, the agent can both read and write memory files. For shared state like organization policies or compliance rules, you may want to make memory **read-only** so the agent can reference it but not modify it. This prevents prompt injection via shared memory and ensures that only your application code controls what's in the file.

| Permission               | Use case                                                                                                                   | How it works                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Read-write** (default) | User preferences, agent self-improvement, learned [skills](/oss/python/deepagents/skills)                                  | Agent updates files via `edit_file` tool                                                                                                                               |
| **Read-only**            | Organization policies, compliance rules, shared knowledge bases, developer-defined [skills](/oss/python/deepagents/skills) | Populate via application code or the [Store API](/langsmith/custom-store). Use [policy hooks](/oss/python/deepagents/backends#add-policy-hooks) to block agent writes. |

**Security considerations:** If one user can write to memory that another user reads, a malicious user could inject instructions into shared state. To mitigate this:

* **Default to user scope** `(user_id)` unless you have a specific reason to share
* Use **read-only memory** for shared policies (populate via application code, not the agent)
* Add **human-in-the-loop** validation before the agent writes to shared memory. Use an [interrupt](/oss/python/langgraph/capabilities/human-in-the-loop) to require human approval for writes to sensitive paths.

To enforce read-only memory, use [policy hooks](/oss/python/deepagents/backends#add-policy-hooks) on the backend to reject write operations to specific paths.

### Concurrent writes

Multiple threads can write to memory in parallel, but concurrent writes to the **same file** can cause last-write-wins conflicts. For user-scoped memory this is rare since users typically have one active conversation at a time. For agent-scoped or organization-scoped memory, consider using [background consolidation](#background-consolidation) to serialize writes, or structure memory as separate files per topic to reduce contention.

In practice, if a write fails due to a conflict, the LLM is usually smart enough to retry or recover gracefully, so a single lost write is not catastrophic.

### Multiple agents in the same deployment

To give each agent its own memory in a shared deployment, add `assistant_id` to the namespace:

```python  theme={"theme":{"light":"catppuccin-latte","dark":"catppuccin-mocha"}}
StoreBackend(
    namespace=lambda ctx: (
        get_config()["metadata"]["assistant_id"],
        ctx.runtime.context.user_id,
    ),
)
```

Use `(assistant_id,)` alone if you only need per-agent isolation without per-user scoping.

<Tip>
  Use [LangSmith tracing](/langsmith/tracing) to audit what your agent writes to memory. Every file write appears as a tool call in the trace.
